In truth, I am very much given to the idea that distinct learning styles are a canard more than anything - I was given several tests regarding my own alleged proclitivities several times over the course of my educational career, and routinely have the results of those tests been at odds, and more routinely have I questioned the wisdom of the formula whatsoever. As the linked article describes, there's little evidence that different people have substantially better responses to different learning styles, which can only make sense. The learning styles themselves are both too narrow and too broad, and the very biologic efficacy can be brought into question - the modes of interaction differ across sensory lines, of course, but the core objective of committing information to long-term memory remains the same, as does the areas of the brain interfaced with when true learning is mounted. Once more, as the article goes on to describe, studies have shown that differentiated learning styles don't measurably impact the quality or permanence of learning. Above all, it's the epitome of pop psychology - an idea that seems at once simple, useful, and true, but upon further investigation is none of the three.
