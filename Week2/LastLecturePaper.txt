I found Randy Pausch's 'last lecture' to be highly engaging and entertaining - I hadn't heard of the man beforehand, and the scope of the work he had done in his life was truly impressive, from pioneering virtual reality tech to Disney Imagineering to building new ways for people to learn programming. I really related to a lot of his ideas about brick walls, and their position as not precisely blocking movement, but ensuring that only the most dedicated can traverse them, only those truly worthy. I have faced a lot of pretty solid brick walls in my life, homelessness to say the least, and for a good stretch of time I was firmly convinced that I was never going to climb out of the hole I had dug for myself, that the brick wall in front of me would be my end. But, to my own surprise, I kept working, kept laboring, and managed to not only exit homelessness, but go back to college and finish my degree too - as is the point of this, my very final semester. It's as Pausch said towards the end of the lecture, if you run your life with forthrightness and sticktoitiveness, then the ability to achieve your childhood dreams will present themselves. Personally, I'm still a ways out from my childhood dream, the Presidency of the United States, but I've gotten out of bigger messes before. What also brought me great interest was how much Pausch committed to his promise in the beginning to not talk about his cancer - bringing it up but only once, at the beginning, was quite a powerful move to make, and strengthened the core message of the rest of his speech significantly. Overall, Pausch gave an inspiring and uplifting speech that I will have to revisit from time to time to give myself proper perspective on the challenges I face in life.
