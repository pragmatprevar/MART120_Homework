The move from command line to graphic user interfaces – CLI to GUI – is unarguably one of the most important front-end innovations in the history of computing. Both are ways of allowing the user to interact with the computer’s nested file system, of directories of folders within folders within folders. GUIs depicts this pictorally, displaying in a neat grid the files within the given directory. Control is had with the mouse and various key combos to manipulate the displayed files in some way. The CLI only has an output of text, and can similarly only be interfaced with text. A specified list of text commands can be used to change the current directory and sub-directory the user is accessing, as well as manipulate the files within the current directory and sub-directory. Through the predictability of inputs and outputs, manipulation of files can be mounted faster in a CLI than in a GUI, and so too will the speed of processing be increased by the reallocation of processing power from calculating and drawing a graphical interface representing the given directory and sub-directory. CLIs can also be found at the root of all operating systems, with macOS and Linux grouped under Unix specifically.
