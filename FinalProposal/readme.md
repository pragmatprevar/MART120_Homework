I plan to make as my final project a mini sequencer, with four measures of four beats that you can change the pitch or instrument of, or make it a rest. The program will loop the notes that are on the screen continously.

Similar work that is serving as inspiration would be the town theme menu from Animal Crossing: New Leaf, as well as the various projects of Incredibox. Both use very user-friendly tools to let users who may have no training in music whatsoever make a neat little ditty, and that's what I intend to do here.

I'll have to learn the features p5.js has for playing and modulating sound - will I need different audio files for each toned note, or is there an ability to change that from within the code. I'll also need to learn more about importing images to p5.js, as I'd like to have a well put-together interface not simply drawn from simple shapes and text.

4/30 - Finish UI, develop rudimentary note-changing system
5/1 - Implement UI provisionally, note problems interfacing with note-changing system
5/2 - Full implementation of desired systems, moving to bugfixing and polish
5/3 - Final touches, fresh eyes, looking for what could make it really pop

So far, I've already begun designing UI elements in paint.NET, my preferred raster image editor, and compositing them together to see what they'll look like combined. I expect to be able to implement these UI pieces shortly.

Note - sincerest apologies for turning this in late, the listing said 4/29 and I was under the impression it was due at 11:59 on the 29th, rather than 12:00 on the 29th.
